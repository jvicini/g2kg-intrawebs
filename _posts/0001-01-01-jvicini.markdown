I a sailor and a developer.  It woudl be nice to do both at the same time.   

<!-- Tell us something interesting. -->

Here's one of my [favorite code snippets](https://gist.github.com/dpetersen/322146).

{% highlight ruby %}
module Kernel
  def the(a, b)
    Exception.new
  end

  def roof
  end

  def yo!
  end
end

raise the roof, yo!
{% endhighlight %}
